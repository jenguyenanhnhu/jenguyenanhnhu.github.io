                <h2>A hacker.</h2>
                <p>I'm Jenny Nguyen or Nguyễn Anh Như -- an early career professional with a wealth of knowledge on the Hallyu Wave, women entrepreneurs in early modern Vietnam, and am an experienced practitioner in the art of slow fashion. I am also an avid reader, an average writer, and an amateur coder, dreaming of the day when I find the perfect intersection between the web, the humanities, and community. </p>

                <p>Through <a class="paragraph-hyperlink" href="https://shecodes.com.au/">She Codes Australia</a> 6-month PLUS program, I learnt how to code and created projects to consolidate my learning.

                    <h4><b>Footnote Journal | Essay</b></h4>
                    <p>When you study history, you get constantly asked, "So what job are you going to get?"</p>
                    <p>Part-memoir, part-history, and part-analysis, I negotiate the unpredictable demands of labour markets and the fluctuating societal value of the humanities and answer the question: am I employable?</p>

                    <p>Long before #BlackLivesMatter exploded in 2020, Indigenous Australians have used social media to express and reaffirm their identity, protest racial injustices, and dismantle 'colonial algorithms'.</p>
                    <p>I researched and co-authored this peer-reviewed journal article with the <a class="paragraph-hyperlink" href="https://atsis.uq.edu.au/indigenous-research/summer-and-winter-research-projects">UQ ATSIS Summer Research</href> program.</p>

                    <p>Did you know that there were female entrepreneurs in early modern Vietnam?</p>
                    <p>Because yes, they existed. In fact, there were so many female traders that women dominated the marketplaces of Southeast Asia. In this blog, I reflect on the major findings of my Honours research.</p>

                    <p>Before there was any academic interest on female entrepreneurship and long before women were conceived of as girl bosses in public consciousness, they were central to the domestic Vietnamese economy.</p>
                    <p>However, this came with a cost. I take another deep dive into my Honours research.</p>
