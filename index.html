            <p>I go by Jenny Nguyen or Nguyễn Anh Như. I am an early career professional who wears many hats.</p>
            <p>I have always been curious and wanted to learn more about society, industry, and the world. As a result, I often put my hand up for anything that comes my way and frequently throw myself into the deep end. Hence, I graduated from an arts degree majoring in History and completed my Honours thesis on Vietnamese women entrepreneurs in the 17th and 18th centuries - only to jump into the tech world as a consultant. It's also led to me accomplishing some really cool and different things, including (but not limited to): being involved in Brisbane's startup community, promoting sustainability in fashion, and empowering young people to have their voice heard. Along the way, I have gained communication and collaboration skills, research and writing skills, and learnt how to be adaptable and flexible in any situation.</p>
