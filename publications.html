                <p>When you study history, you get constantly asked, "So what job are you going to get?"</p>
                <p>Part-memoir, part-history, and part-analysis, I negotiate the unpredictable demands of labour markets and the fluctuating societal value of the humanities and answer the question: am I employable?</p>

                <p>Long before #BlackLivesMatter exploded in 2020, Indigenous Australians have used social media to express and reaffirm their identity, protest racial injustices, and dismantle 'colonial algorithms'.</p>
                <p>I researched and co-authored this peer-reviewed journal article with the <a class="paragraph-hyperlink" href="https://atsis.uq.edu.au/indigenous-research/summer-and-winter-research-projects">UQ ATSIS Summer Research</href> program.</p>

                <p>Did you know that there were female entrepreneurs in early modern Vietnam?</p>
                <p>Because yes, they existed. In fact, there were so many female traders that women dominated the marketplaces of Southeast Asia. In this blog, I reflect on the major findings of my Honours research.</p>

                <h4><b>New Mandala | Article</b></h4>
                <p>Before there was any academic interest on female entrepreneurship and long before women were conceived of as girl bosses in public consciousness, they were central to the domestic Vietnamese economy.</p>
                <p>However, this came with a cost. I take another deep dive into my Honours research.</p>
