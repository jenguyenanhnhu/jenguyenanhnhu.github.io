Yes so this website has been a fascinating time. 

Have fun looking at this. 

The only real issue I have now is on the 'About' page with the slideshow because it's not pulling through the captions properly. I feel this is JS problem and I'll fix it later. 

Update on 26/04/22: So new issue. For some reason, my full bio won't appear on the website, but it's in vs code and it's in my index.html on my Github repo. Where is that on my main page? I have no idea. If you have tips and tricks or know how to fix this, let me know.
