                    <h5>Footnote Journal | Essay</h5>
                    <p>When you study history or the humanities, you are constantly asked, "So what job are you going to get?" I negotiate the unpredictable demands of labour markets and the fluctuating societal value of the arts as an undergraduate history major.</p>

                    <h5>Media International Australia | Peer-Reviewed Journal Article</h5>
                    <p>Indigenous voices and outlooks are often overlooked within public discourses in Australia and throughout the world. Settler-colonialism has resulted in centuries of dispossession, manifesting in the denial of Indigenous citizenship, autonomy and sovereignty. Throughout this article we discuss how Indigenous people are increasingly turning to social media to illuminate how colonialism continues to oppress Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities. In doing so, Indigenous people are disrupting what we call the ‘colonial algorithms’ that shape misguided perceptions of Indigenous people and identities. Analysing Indigenous use of social media and centring our discussion around several Indigenous-led online campaigns, we demonstrate how online platforms are bringing an array of social issues to light in ways that privilege Indigenous voices and perspectives, ultimately disrupting and shifting oppressive colonial algorithms.</p>
